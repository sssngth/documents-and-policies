# Lido on Ethereum Standard Node Operator Protocol – Block Proposals

```markdown!
STATUS: V3.0
```

## A – Purpose
This Standard Node Operator Protocol (SNOP) outlines 
- the standards, Auxiliary Proposer Mechanisms (APMs, see [Appendix A](#appendix-a--ethereum-standards-auxiliary-proposer-mechanisms--infrastructure)) and infrastructure available for block proposals in Ethereum, 
- the rules around the usage of this SNOP, 
- the considerations that guide the expectations of the Lido on Ethereum protocol ("Lido") with regard to block proposals and APMs, 
- the responsibilities Node Operators (NOs) using Lido have in performing block proposals utilizing APMs and distributing the associated rewards to stakers, as well as
- the actions that NOs can expect in case of non-conformance with this SNOP.


## B – Scope
This SNOP applies to Lido, the NOs who use any of the [Staking Router (SR)'s](https://docs.lido.fi/contracts/staking-router) existing Staking Modules (SMs) — [Curated Module (CM)](https://operatorportal.lido.fi/modules/curated-module), [Simple Distributed Validator Technology Module (SDVTM)](https://operatorportal.lido.fi/modules/simple-dvt-module) and [Community Staking Module (CSM)](https://operatorportal.lido.fi/modules/community-staking-module) — a future SM or staking avenue, and the validators the NOs run as part of the protocol.

The below stipulated operational flows and expectations apply to all above-mentioned SMs, except where alternative processes or expectations are defined due to technical or operational differences in specific SMs or staking avenues.

_NOTE: Terminology may vary in meaning depending on context. The table below aims to clarify the usage of key terms for the purposes of this SNOP and within the context of Lido._

## C – Guiding Considerations
As per the [Lido DAO Vibe](https://snapshot.org/#/s:lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x739fbe56425d355b5e41c22bb346b7a8217afd9e84aa49863648b1c641a482e3) and iterated upon by the community in [Guided Open Objective Setting Exercises (GOOSE)](https://snapshot.org/#/s:lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x58bbc5d540e46081043ef29d4d1ee56b7df4dc1b0369aa78e0c15a2403549353), the Lido DAO strives to contribute to the decentralization, accessibility, and censorship resistance of Ethereum. The following guiding considerations for NOs using Lido stem from these overarching goals.

### C.1 – Economic Security
From a game-theoretical perspective, economic competitiveness of the protocol is paramount in order to optimally protect Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus from 51% attacks and to facilitate the positive impact that Lido can have on the network's validator set. The rationale for this is set out in [Hasu's Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) proposal](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-optimal-mev-policy-for-lido/2489).

Advancing this goal entails that NOs using the protocol should attempt to do so in a way that finds a suitable balance between maximizing validator rewards and optimizing duty effectiveness (performing as reliably, timely, correctly, and free of slashable offenses as possible).

Additionally, it makes sense for the Lido ecosystem to enable participants to adopt new Ethereum-aligned standards and infrastructure (following sufficient testing and security assessment) that may improve staking operation and rewards.

Since NOs control the destination for Execution Layer (EL) rewards (see [D.1](#d1--fee-recipient)), there is a possibility that NOs using Lido could try to redirect EL rewards received from the validators they operate in an attempt to earn more than the programmatically defined share of the protocol rewards. In the best interest of stakers and honest NOs, protocol mechanics make rewards stealing through the use of Lido difficult to conceal, expensive to execute, and should carry a penalty.

Regardless of whether NOs use the protocol via [permissionless bonded](https://operatorportal.lido.fi/modules/community-staking-module#block-88e6d7eca6364a758541dc1ee66a278f) or permissioned reputation-based SMs, it is important that NO activities are transparently monitored to ensure fair conditions. For this purpose, a multitude of community-built open-source [tools](https://operatorportal.lido.fi/existing-operator-portal/ethereum-onboarding/no-resources-tooling) and [dashboards](https://operatorportal.lido.fi/operator-statistics-and-metrics) are publicly available.

### C.2 – Decentralization & Operational Diversity
Decentralization is one of the Lido DAO's core values and its continued improvement, just like that of economic security, an integral premise for the robustness of the Ethereum network. For this reason, the Lido community should prioritize balancing economic security with decentralization and operational diversity to promote the health of Ethereum.

Varied validation setups — such as through geographic dispersion, infrastructure and client diversification, etc. — are critical for proactively mitigating risks of local outages, isolated bugs, and for reducing Ethereum network latency on a global scale. NOs using Lido are encouraged to contribute to these sustained efforts; historically, Lido stakers and community participants have strongly supported NOs in expanding their infrastructure to underrepresented geographic regions and in adopting diversified, multi-client setups.

Another important aspect of decentralization is [credible neutrality](https://nakamoto.com/credible-neutrality/). For Lido's NO set this generally entails openly participating in and using a variety of — potentially competing — software clients, infrastructure technologies and — in the case of APMs — mechanism or protocol implementations. Nevertheless, the principle of credible neutrality should be balanced against operational and technical security considerations, as the community sets out guidelines around what tooling can be used and how.

### C.3 – Censorship Resistance
A third attribute to balance — alongside the dimensions of economic security, and decentralization and operational diversity — is censorship resistance.

Although out-of-protocol proposer-builder separation (PBS, see [Appendix A.4.1](#a41--proposer-builder-separation)) was introduced as a concept to weaken incentives that might lead to highly verticalized validator operations, its opt-in nature, the high centralization of builders, and the necessity for explicit MEV relay selection due to the implicit trust assumptions in the mechanism make it possible that Ethereum transactions can still be censored. In fact, censorship rarely takes place at the [level of the validators](https://censorship.pics/), but rather most often occurs at that of builders and (in the past) relays.

As outlined in Decentralization & Operational Diversity (see [C.2](#c2--decentralization--operational-diversity)), credible neutrality is a vital part of a healthy Ethereum and credible neutrality in turn supported by participants that enable the censorship resistance of the network. As such, the design of Lido allows NOs to participate in accordance with their respective laws and regulations, while also empowering unconstrained NOs to advance and bolster the network's efforts towards censorship resistance. Similarly, given the fully on-chain and decentralized nature of the Lido protocol, stakers and the wider community can discover [the NOs’ impact on the network's censorship resistance](https://app.hex.tech/8dedcd99-17f4-49d8-944e-4857a355b90a/app/3f7d6967-3ef6-4e69-8f7b-d02d903f045b/latest?tab=all-stats#censorship-resistance) and, thanks to the increased directional control over deposits in Lido V3, make decisions about how to best allocate their stake.

## D – Node Operator Responsibilities
Based on the guiding considerations above, the following responsibilities arise for NOs using Lido regarding the block proposal configuration of the pertinent validators they run. Moreover, this section outlines how stakers and the community can assess NO behavior and conformance – e.g., by using the [Lido Fees Monitoring Dashboard](https://fees-monitoring.lido.fi/) ("Monitoring Dashboard").

### D.1 – Fee Recipient
For all validators run using Lido, the Execution Layer Rewards Vault for the [relevant Ethereum network](https://docs.lido.fi/deployed-contracts/) should be configured as the fee recipient (FR) through the appropriate setting in the consensus client (CC), validator client (VC) and/or signing service of choice.

In the Monitoring Dashboard, proposed blocks labeled with "unknown FR" could indicate either a misconfiguration of an NO's infrastructure regarding the FR, or a possible stealing attempt.

### D.2 – APMs Allowed List
NOs may utilize APMs that have been vetted by the community and are included in the [APMs Allowed List](), which is maintained by the DAO-appointed [APM Committee](https://research.lido.fi/t/establishing-the-apm-committee/9998). This list comprises APMs that have been assessed as sufficiently de-risked and demonstrably beneficial to both Lido and the broader Ethereum ecosystem. Any APM seeking inclusion in the list must follow the standard evaluation and vetting process.

NOs utilizing APMs, for each applicable validator, must adhere to all relevant configuration requirements, security best practices, and guidelines, including relating to the distribution of associated rewards, as defined in this SNOP, the APMs Allowed List and its referenced documentation for the relevant APM(s).

### D.3 – Operational Best Practices
NOs who opt-in to run validators using Lido and utilize vetted APMs must generally, apart from any specific stipulations for each APM, adhere to the following principles:
- Manage the operation and monitoring of validation setups to balance rewards and duty-effectiveness, except where deviations are expressly permitted to serve the objectives outlined in the Guiding Considerations section (see [C](#c--guiding-considerations)), as per the allowable parameters defined either in this document or the instructions for usage of an APM.
- Distribute the lion's share of both directly associated and indirectly attributable rewards (e.g., via APM-protocol-specific airdrops) to stakers in accordance with the allocation determined by the Lido protocol and/or APM Committee for the respective case.
- Refrain from utilizing an optional APM if its use generally results in decreased value or increased operational instability compared to other APMs, unless there are specific exceptions granted by the Lido community through the APM Committee.

### D.4 – Out-Of-Protocol PBS

#### D.4.1 – MEV Boost Relay Allowed List
Currently, unless by exception due to incompatible APM interactions, NOs must utilize out-of-protocol PBS and configure for all validators run using Lido in the CC or out-of-protocol PBS sidecar of choice (see [Appendix A.4](#a4--auxiliary-proposer-mechanisms)) the address(es) of at least one vetted relay labeled "must use some" and any number of relays labeled "may use" from the MEV Boost Relay Allowed List – found on the [Node Operator Portal](https://enchanted-direction-844.notion.site/6d369eb33f664487800b0dedfe32171e?v=d255247c822c409f99c498aeb6a4e51d) or by querying the `get_relays` method of the smart contract for the [relevant Ethereum network](https://docs.lido.fi/deployed-contracts/). Any relay seeking inclusion in the list must follow the standard registration process and successfully undergo vetting for performance, data transparency, and operational sufficiency by the [Relay Maintenance Committee (RMC)](https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-on-ethereum-identify-and-constitute-relay-maintenance-committee/3386).

In the Monitoring Dashboard, proposed blocks labeled with "unknown payload source (PS)" and/or abnormally high incidence of proposed blocks with payloads exclusively sourced from "may use" relays could indicate the potential misconfiguration of an NO's infrastructure in regard to the MEV Boost Relay Allowed List.

#### D.4.2 – Troubleshooting
In cases vetted relays and/or builders experience operational issues – e.g., payloads being constructed incorrectly, payload headers, response messages and/or unblinded payloads not being propagated timely, or crucial APIs being unresponsive – NOs should report the issue to the wider NO community and may disable the affected relays until service has been sufficiently and satisfactorily restored. In case that relays do not resume nominal operation, the community and/or RMC shall move to communicate the situation and effectuate the faulty relays from the MEV Boost Relay Allowed List.

### D.5 – Local Block Building
NOs may configure validators run using Lido to enable local block building (see [Appendix A.3](#a3–-local-block-building)) in ways that may reduce reliance on relays when the incremental value of an outsourced block is low and increase the network's censorship resistance, within certain acceptable parameters. Given the evolving technical options and volatile market conditions of the network, the methods and values permitted with regards to local block building are determined by social consensus between NOs, Lido DAO contributors, and the wider staking community via the [Lido Node Operator MEV Boost min-bid guidance thread](https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-node-operator-mev-boost-min-bid-guidance/3347) on the [Lido Research Forum](https://research.lido.fi/).

NOs opting into the local block building parameterization must adhere to all relevant configuration requirements defined in this SNOP and the Lido Node Operator MEV Boost min-bid guidance thread.

In the Monitoring Dashboard, proposed blocks labeled with "unknown PS" may indicate a potential misconfiguration of an NO's infrastructure with regards to local block building.

## E – Consequences of Non-Conformance
When potential NO non-conformance with protocol rules and expectations is observed, the below actions shall be taken. The actions and follow-up procedures may differ based on the SM or staking avenue. For example, while NOs are known (i.e., identified) for the permissioned CM and SDVTM, NOs of the permissionless CSM may remain anonymous and reaching the NOs is only possible if a contact is voluntarily shared with the community. Furthermore, bonded SMs, like the CSM, offer additional options for automated conformance mechanisms compared to bond-less SMs like the CM and SDVTM.

The following table outlines the consequences for non-conformance with the Node Operator Responsibilities (see [D](#d--node-operator-responsibilities)) in regard to block proposals in Lido, and for which SM each action applies.

Action|CM|SDVTM|CSM
---|:---:|:---:|:---:
Upon detection of an unknown FR, contributors to the NOM workstream will reach out to the NO and ask for a clarification. If force majeure can be ruled out as the cause of the incident and no plausible explanation be provided, it must be assumed that the FR has been incorrectly configured and/or the proposed block's rewards have been stolen. Consequently, depending on the severity of the case, community members may consider raising a formal issue with the NO on the Lido Research Forum, requesting remediative action, seeking the transfer of missing rewards to the Lido Execution Layer Rewards Vault (see [D.1](#d1–-fee-recipient)), or other actions up to and including offboarding of the NO.|:heavy_check_mark:|:heavy_check_mark:|:x:
Upon detection of an unknown FR, an amount of the affected NO's bond equal to the respective block's rewards and an additional disincentive of 0.1 ETH is algorithmically locked for 8 weeks, and the NO afforded a challenge period to discuss the situation in the [CSM Support category](https://research.lido.fi/c/csm-support/21) of the Lido Research Forum. Once the NO compensates Lido for the incident or upon expiry of the challenge period – if an agreement has been reached, that force majeure was the cause of the event – the lock is lifted. If neither a plausible explanation can be provided, nor a compensation is being transferred to the Lido Execution Layer Rewards Vault (see [D.1](#d1–-fee-recipient)), the [CSM Committee](https://research.lido.fi/t/community-staking-module-committee/8333) will initiate an [Easy Track motion](https://lido.fi/governance#easy-track) to propose to the Lido DAO that the locked portion of the NO's bond be burned as a penalty.<br>Any of the NO's validators that fail to provide a full bond – i.e. become unbonded – as a result of this measure are [requested to exit the protocol](https://lido.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmZTMfmJZsYHz61f2FjhYdh5VNu6ifjYQJzYUGkysHs8Uu). If the requested validators are not exited, they are marked as stuck, and no operator rewards are distributed to the NO until the stuck keys are exited.<br>**_NOTE:_** After the implementation of [EIP-7002: Execution Layer Triggerable Withdrawals](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7002) into Lido, stuck validators will instead be forcefully ejected at the protocol level.|:x:|:x:|:heavy_check_mark:
Upon detection of unintended proposal behavior potentially caused by suboptimal operational practices, contributors to the NOM workstream (in the CSM: CSM Committee) will (attempt to) reach out to the NO and ask for a clarification. If force majeure can be ruled out as the cause of the incident and no plausible explanation be provided, it must be assumed that the validation setup was neglectfully managed. Consequently, depending on the severity of the case, community members may consider raising a formal issue with the NO on the Lido Research Forum, requesting remediative action, seeking the transfer of missing rewards to the Lido Execution Layer Rewards Vault (see [D.1](#d1–-fee-recipient)), or other actions up to and including offboarding of the NO.|:heavy_check_mark:|:heavy_check_mark:|If NO is identifiable
Upon detection of an unknown PS or an abnormally high incidence of proposed blocks with payloads exclusively sourced from "may use" relays, contributors to the NOM workstream (in the CSM: CSM Committee) will (attempt to) reach out to the NO and ask for a clarification.

# Appendix

## Appendix A – Ethereum Standards, Auxiliary Proposer Mechanisms & Infrastructure

### A.1 – Advancing Ethereum's State
Advancing Ethereum's state revolves around appending new blocks to the blockchain and begins with the PoS consensus mechanism pseudo-randomly allocating the block proposal duty for an upcoming slot to one of the active validators. Once the allocated slot arrives, the validator compiles relevant [Consensus Layer (CL) and EL data](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/blocks/#block-anatomy) into a block, signs, and broadcasts it to the network. The other validators then check the proposed block for validity and issue attestations voting for the chain they view as canonical. If the proposed block receives the heaviest attestation weight, it is selected as the chain head according to the [fork choice rule](https://eth2book.info/capella/part2/consensus/lmd_ghost/). The block can then be [finalized](https://eth2book.info/capella/part2/consensus/casper_ffg/) when two-thirds of the validator stake has attested to it and its descendants, thus ultimately updating the global state of Ethereum.

Sometimes, a validator fails to populate a block with information beyond the minimum structure and header required for validity, or to propose an otherwise valid block to the network altogether. These so-called "empty blocks" and "missed slots" lead to the Ethereum state remaining unchanged. Another exceptional case is a block that is temporarily part of the canonical chain, but replaced by another block before finalization through events such as reorganizations ("reorgs") and "forks" of Ethereum's [Gasper consensus mechanism](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/gasper/). This can happen, e.g., because the block was proposed to the network too late to reach and obtain the attestations of a sufficient number of validators, because the blockchain split due to changes in (or differing interpretations of) protocol rules, or via changes to state or rules enforced via social consensus (a user-activated "soft fork"). Blocks that are abandoned before they become finalized are called "orphans".

### A.2 – Beacon Node APIs
The [Beacon Node APIs](https://ethereum.github.io/beacon-APIs) are exposed by beacon nodes (BNs) enabling the CC or VC to query and participate in the Beacon Chain (BC) according to [Ethereum's consensus specification](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs) as implemented by the different clients. The Beacon Node APIs are relevant to this SNOP both as the standard implemented which enables nodes to perform fundamental validator duties but also as the broader mechanism through which some APMs integrate into and augment the block proposal process – usually via the Builder API, which is technically separate and also entails connection with the EL (see [Appendix A.4.1.2](#a412–-builder-api)).

### A.3 – Local Block Building
In local block building, the validator allocated to the proposal duty of a slot packs transactions to be included in the block up to at most its [gas limit](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/#block-size) through the use of the attached execution client (EC). The transactions can originate from the NO of the validator itself, from users who sent them to the NO via some side-channel mechanism for inclusion, and most likely and predominantly from Ethereum's public mempool through the EL gossip network. A locally-built block by a validator is sometimes referred to as "vanilla".

### A.4 – Auxiliary Proposer Mechanisms
APMs provide a structured framework for evaluating and reason about the role of mechanisms, protocols, and sidecars that operate alongside Ethereum validators in its evolving consensus environment. Together these three main components of the [APM Framework](https://research.lido.fi/t/introducing-the-apm-framework-mechanisms-protocols-and-sidecars/9884) enable enhanced functionality compared to the default block proposal process:

- Mechanisms define an objective and a method to achieve it within the Ethereum block proposal process. They establish the fundamental logic guiding proposer behavior – e.g., the PBS mechanism.
- Protocols are structured specifications of the standards, rules, and configurations for a given mechanism. They can exist in-protocol, out-of-protocol, or as hybrids (within the Ethereum ecosystem), shaping how mechanisms operate in practice – e.g., MEV-Boost as an out-of-protocol specification for the PBS mechanism.
- Sidecars are services or software components that support protocols, acting alongside validator software to enable their functionality – e.g., MEV-Boost as a client-side software to participate in the MEV-Boost protocol.

Protocols may also introduce additional clients or require modifications to existing node software. While these aren't strictly classified as sidecars, they function similarly within the APM Framework. Examples include mev-geth and the MEV-Boost Relay client.

A single mechanism can be implemented by multiple protocols, which in turn may rely on various sidecars. This generally follows a 1:n:n relationship – one mechanism can have multiple protocols, and each protocol can be enabled by multiple sidecars. In some cases, a sidecar may even support multiple protocols.

In order to assess security, operational robustness, and value chain impact, APMs undergo a structured vetting process before adoption. This process aids in the mitigation of risks, assesses benefits, and sets protocol standards for their integration into Lido's NO set.

As the field of APMs is a rapidly changing landscape of software offerings and implementations, the APMs Allowed List (see [D.2](#d2--apms-allowed-list)) is maintained by the APM Committee as a separate document in the Lido GitHub repository so that it may be revised and updated timely.

#### A.4.1 – Proposer-Builder Separation
[PBS](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/pbs_censorship_resistance) is a mechanism designated to address the increasing complexity of the block proposal process and concerns around increasing centralization of the stack by sophisticated actors. PBS resolves this by separating two aspects of the proposal process – the construction of the [execution payload](https://eth2book.info/capella/part3/containers/execution/#executionpayload) and the proposal of the block and its contents (including the payload). The separation of roles reduces the complexity for the proposer, who – in contrast to local block building (see [Appendix A.3](#a3–-local-block-building)) – only has to select from payloads constructed and propagated by specialized third-party builders who compete in an auction, wrap that payload in a block, and propose it to the network. This allows operators who have more limited resources (e.g., weaker hardware) to fulfill block proposal duties and actively contribute to the security of the network, while still being competitive with proposers who have more resources at their disposal.

##### A.4.1.1 – Out-Of-Protocol PBS & MEV-Boost
In the case of PBS, although a concept discussed since before The Merge, there has not been an in-protocol version of it implemented into the core protocol (some options have been proposed, e.g., [EIP-7732: Enshrined Proposer-Builder Separation (ePBS)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7732)). Currently, the de facto standard of out-of-protocol PBS in Ethereum is MEV-Boost. 
[MEV-Boost](https://boost.flashbots.net/) is [Flashbot's reference design proposal](https://ethresear.ch/t/mev-boost-merge-ready-flashbots-architecture/11177) for a [PBS-friendly MEV marketplace](https://ethresear.ch/t/proposer-block-builder-separation-friendly-fee-market-designs/9725), whose architecture served as basis for the specification of Ethereum's Builder API (see [Appendix A.4.1.2](#a412–-builder-api)). The combination of Builder API and MEV-Boost – the protocol, corresponding relay client and BN sidecar – is the current most widespread implementation of out-of-protocol PBS.

MEV-Boost has also addressed concerns about a weakness of PBS in terms of protecting Ethereum's censorship resistance that had already been expressed for in-protocol variants. The [minimum bid value ("min-bid")](https://www.flashbots.net/#9f18e7f297d6443c895d870df3ee5d2a) is a setting that allows proposers to forego a limited amount of rewards and, instead of sourcing externally constructed payloads for slots where the highest bid is below the min-bid configured by the proposer, generate payloads locally (see [Appendix A.3](#a3–-local-block-building)) – which increases the likelihood of inclusion for transactions which may be left out by third-party builders for reasons other than their pure value.

##### A.4.1.2 – Builder API
[Ethereum's temporary out-of-protocol PBS solution](https://ethereum.github.io/builder-specs/), for validators to delegate the payload construction duty of allocated slots to external builders. The Builder API has been designed to establish a direct one-to-one connection between a proposer and a builder, as configured in the proposer's CC. The MEV-Boost protocol and relevant out-of-protocol PBS sidecar implementations extend this functionality by interfacing with the Builder API in a multiplexer-like fashion allowing the proposer to connect to a multitude of builders (through relays). 

##### A.4.1.3 – Builder & Relay Operator Responsibilities & Incident Management
Given the trusted nature of out-of-protocol PBS, it behooves builder and relay operators to ensure that they and the infrastructure they operate function effectively, performantly, and efficiently, and that any and all communications are made timely and professionally.

Builder and relay operators should notify relevant Lido stakeholders – e.g., NOs and the NOM workstream – as soon as possible upon identification of an issue with any of the infrastructure that they operate. Notification may be performed through public – e.g., the Lido Research Forum or Discord – and/or private channels – e.g., Telegram group chats – so that NOs can proceed with appropriate changes to their configurations.

During an incident, builder and relay operators should provide regular updates with regard to the status. Following the conclusion, the operators should provide a report or post-mortem that details at minimum the root cause, fixes performed, if/how soon the infrastructure will be back in service, and what steps have been undertaken to prevent the likelihood of similar incidents in the future. Additionally, in cases where block production was adversely affected (see [D.4.2](#d42--troubleshooting)), the operators should advise as to what steps will be taken – if any – to reimburse validators for any missed, invalid, etc. blocks and/or inaccurate bids.

Incidents will be reviewed on an ad-hoc basis by the NO and Lido communities. These reviews will inform DAO governance decisions regarding whether relay operators and the relays that they operate will continue to be considered vetted and ratified for use by NOs or not.

Relay operators which exhibit poor or otherwise unacceptable communication and especially performance of their relays – such as, but not limited to, inability to performantly and timely register validators or propagate bids and payloads, not verify bids, not simulate payload validity, etc. – and/or fail to conform with the expectations outlined above with regard to incident management, will be subject to removal from the MEV Boost Relay Allowed List (see [D.4.1](#d41--mev-boost-relay-allowed-list)).
