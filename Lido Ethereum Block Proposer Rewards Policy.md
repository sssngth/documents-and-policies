# Lido on Ethereum Standard Node Operator Protocol – Block Proposals

```markdown!
STATUS: V3.0
```

## A – Purpose
This Standard Node Operator Protocol (SNOP) outlines the standards, Auxiliary Proposer Mechanisms (APMs, see [Appendix A](#appendix-a–-ethereum-standards-auxiliary-proposer-mechanisms–infrastructure)) and infrastructure available for block proposals in Ethereum, the rules around the usage of this SNOP, the considerations that guide the expectations of the Lido on Ethereum protocol ("Lido") with regard to block proposals and APMs, the responsibilities Node Operators (NOs) using Lido have in performing block proposals utilizing APMs and distributing the associated rewards to stakers, and the actions that NOs can expect in case of non-conformance with this SNOP.

## B – Scope
This SNOP applies to Lido, the NOs who use one or more of the [Staking Router (SR)'s](https://docs.lido.fi/contracts/staking-router) [Curated Module (CM)](https://operatorportal.lido.fi/modules/curated-module), [Simple Distributed Validator Technology Module (SDVTM)](https://operatorportal.lido.fi/modules/simple-dvt-module), [Community Staking Module (CSM)](https://operatorportal.lido.fi/modules/community-staking-module), future Staking Modules (SMs) or staking avenues, and the validators the NOs operate as part of the protocol.

The below stipulated operational flows and expectations apply to all above-mentioned SMs, except in cases where specific mentions are made to alternate flows or expectations for specific SMs due to differences in their technical or operational characteristics.

**_NOTE:_** As terms can have different meanings based on how they are used and in different contexts, the table below aims to clarify the usage of various terms for the purposes of this SNOP and how they apply within the context of Lido.

## C – Guiding Considerations
As per the [Lido DAO Vibe](https://snapshot.org/#/s:lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x739fbe56425d355b5e41c22bb346b7a8217afd9e84aa49863648b1c641a482e3) and iterated upon by the community in [Guided Open Objective Setting Exercises (GOOSE)](https://snapshot.org/#/s:lido-snapshot.eth/proposal/0x58bbc5d540e46081043ef29d4d1ee56b7df4dc1b0369aa78e0c15a2403549353), the Lido DAO strives to contribute to the decentralization, accessibility, and censorship resistance of Ethereum. The following guiding considerations for NOs using Lido thus flow from these overarching goals.

### C.1 – Economic Security
Game-theoretically, to optimally protect Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus from 51% attacks and to facilitate the positive impact that Lido can have on the network's validator set, economic competitiveness of the protocol is paramount. The rationale for this is set out in [Hasu's Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) proposal](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-optimal-mev-policy-for-lido/2489).

Advancing this goal entails that NOs using the protocol should attempt to do so in a way that finds a suitable balance between validator rewards and duty-effectiveness optimization as well as – attesting to and proposing new blocks, participating in sync committees, and reporting network violations of the slashing rules – as reliably, timely, correctly, and free of slashable offenses as possible.

Additionally, it makes sense for the Lido ecosystem to enable participants to adopt new Ethereum-aligned standards and infrastructure (following sufficient testing and security assessment) that may improve staking operation and rewards.

Since NOs control the destination for Execution Layer (EL) rewards (see [D.1](#d1–-fee-recipient)), there is a possibility that NOs using Lido could try to redirect EL rewards received in an attempt to earn more than the programmatically intended share of the protocol rewards. In the best interest of stakers and honest NOs, protocol mechanics make rewards stealing through the use of Lido difficult to conceal and expensive to execute, and should carry a penalty. Irrespective of whether NOs use the protocol via [bonded](https://operatorportal.lido.fi/modules/community-staking-module#block-88e6d7eca6364a758541dc1ee66a278f) or reputation-based SMs, to ensure fair conditions, it is important for NO activities to be transparently monitorable. For this purpose, a multitude of community-built open-source [tools](https://operatorportal.lido.fi/existing-operator-portal/ethereum-onboarding/no-resources-tooling) and [dashboards](https://operatorportal.lido.fi/operator-statistics-and-metrics) are openly available.

In the context of APMs, attention is to be paid to the potential implications that attaching new mechanisms to the validation process may have on the block construction and proposal value chain, specifically with respect to the resulting value and contents of blocks proposed by NOs using Lido.

### C.2 – Decentralization & Operational Diversity
Decentralization is one of the core values of the Lido DAO and its prevalence, just like that of economic security, an integral premise for the robustness of the Ethereum network. For this reason, the objective function of Lido should balance economic security with decentralization and operational diversity to promote the health and robustness of the Ethereum network.

Diverse validation setups, such as through geographic dispersion, infrastructure and client diversification, etc. are critical to proactively mitigate risks of local outages, isolated bugs, and to globally reduce Ethereum network latency. NOs using Lido are encouraged to drive these sustained efforts and historically Lido stakers and community participants have been immensely supportive of NOs expanding their infrastructure to underrepresented geographic regions and of the utilization of diversified, multi-client setups.

Another important aspect of decentralization is [credible neutrality](https://nakamoto.com/credible-neutrality/). For NOs using Lido this generally entails openly participating in and using a variety of perhaps competing software clients, infrastructure technologies and, in the case of APMs, mechanism/protocol implementations. Nevertheless, the principle of credible neutrality should be balanced against operational and technical security considerations as the community sets out guidelines around what tooling can be used and how.

### C.3 – Censorship Resistance
A third attribute to balance along with the dimensions of economic security, decentralization and operational diversity, is censorship resistance.

Although out-of-protocol proposer-builder separation (PBS) was introduced as a concept in an attempt to weaken incentives that might lead to highly centralized, verticalized validator operations (see [Appendix A.4.1 ff](#a41–-proposer-builder-separation)), its opt-in nature, the high centralization of builders, and the necessity for explicit MEV relay selection due to the implicit trust assumptions in the mechanism mean that Ethereum transactions can still be censored. In fact, censorship rarely takes place at the [level of the validators](https://censorship.pics/), but rather most often occurs at that of builders and relays.

As outlined in the Decentralization & Operational Diversity (see [C.2](#c2–-decentralization–operational-diversity)) section, credible neutrality is a vital part of a healthy Ethereum and credible neutrality supported by participants that enable the censorship resistance of the network. As such, the design of the Lido protocol allows NOs to participate in a manner that's in accordance with their respective laws and regulations, but also allows for NOs who are unconstrained to advance and bolster the network's properties of censorship resistance. Similarly, thanks to the transparency created by Lido being a fully on-chain decentralized protocol, stakers and the wider community can assess the [impact on the network's censorship resistance](https://app.hex.tech/8dedcd99-17f4-49d8-944e-4857a355b90a/app/3f7d6967-3ef6-4e69-8f7b-d02d903f045b/latest?ref=blog.lido.fi&tab=all-stats#censorship-resistance) and make decisions about how to best allocate their stake.

## D – Node Operator Responsibilities
Based on the guiding considerations above, the following responsibilities arise for NOs using Lido regarding the block proposal configuration of the pertinent validators they run. Moreover, this section outlines how stakers and the community can assess NO behavior and conformance – e.g., by using the [Lido Fees Monitoring Dashboard](https://fees-monitoring.lido.fi/) ("Monitoring Dashboard").

### D.1 – Fee Recipient
For all validators run using Lido, the Execution Layer Rewards Vault for the [relevant Ethereum network](https://docs.lido.fi/deployed-contracts/) should be configured as the fee recipient (FR) through the appropriate setting in the consensus client (CC), validator client (VC) and/or signing service of choice.

In the Monitoring Dashboard, proposed blocks labeled with "unknown FR" indicate either a misconfiguration of an NO's infrastructure regarding the FR, or a possible stealing attempt.

### D.2 – APMs Allowed List
NOs may utilize APMs that have been vetted by the community and are included in the [APMs Allowed List](), which is maintained by the DAO-appointed [APM Committee](https://research.lido.fi/t/establishing-the-apm-committee/9998). This list comprises APMs that have been assessed as sufficiently de-risked and demonstrably beneficial to both Lido and the broader Ethereum ecosystem. Any APM seeking inclusion in the list must follow the standard evaluation and vetting process.

NOs utilizing APMs, for each applicable validator, must adhere to all relevant configuration requirements, security best practices, and guidelines, including relating to the distribution of associated rewards, as defined in this SNOP, the APMs Allowed List and its referenced documentation for the relevant APM(s).

### D.3 – Out-Of-Protocol PBS 
#### D.3.1 – MEV Boost Relay Allowed List
Currently, unless by exception due to incompatible APM interactions, NOs must utilize out-of-protocol PBS and configure for all validators run using Lido in the CC or out-of-protocol PBS sidecar of choice (see [Appendix A.4.1.4](#a414–-sidecars)) the address(es) of at least one vetted relay labeled "must use some" and any number of relays labeled "may use" from the MEV Boost Relay Allowed List – found on the [Node Operator Portal](https://enchanted-direction-844.notion.site/6d369eb33f664487800b0dedfe32171e?v=d255247c822c409f99c498aeb6a4e51d) or by querying the `get_relays` method of the smart contract for the [relevant Ethereum network](https://docs.lido.fi/deployed-contracts/). Any relay seeking inclusion in the list must follow the standard registration process and successfully undergo vetting for performance, data transparency, and operational sufficiency by the [Relay Maintenance Committee (RMC)](https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-on-ethereum-identify-and-constitute-relay-maintenance-committee/3386).

In the Monitoring Dashboard, proposed blocks labeled with "unknown payload source (PS)" and such exclusively with payloads sourced from "may use" relays, although at the beginning of the allocated slots there were more valuable payloads available through "must use some" relays, indicate the potential misconfiguration of an NO's infrastructure in regard to the MEV Boost Relay Allowed List.

#### D.3.2 – Troubleshooting
In cases vetted relays and/or builders experience operational issues – e.g. payloads being constructed incorrectly, payload headers, response messages and/or unblinded payloads not being propagated timely, or crucial APIs being unresponsive – NOs should report the issue to the wider NO community and may disable the affected relays until service has been sufficiently and satisfactorily restored. In case that relays do not resume nominal operation, the community and/or RMC shall move to communicate the situation and effectuate the faulty relays from the MEV Boost Relay Allowed List.

### D.4 – Local Block Building
NOs may configure validators run using Lido to enable local block building (see [Appendix A.3](#a3–-local-block-building)) in ways that may reduce reliance on relays when the incremental value of an outsourced block is low and increase the network's censorship resistance, within certain acceptable parameters. Given the evolving technical options and volatile market conditions of the network, the methods and values permitted with regards to local block building are determined by social consensus between NOs, Lido DAO contributors, and the wider staking community via the [Lido Node Operator MEV Boost min-bid guidance thread](https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-node-operator-mev-boost-min-bid-guidance/3347) on the [Lido Research Forum](https://research.lido.fi/).

NOs opting into the local block building parameterization must adhere to all relevant configuration requirements defined in this SNOP and the Local Block Building Allowance thread.

In the Monitoring Dashboard, proposed blocks labeled with "unknown PS" may indicate a potential misconfiguration of an NO's infrastructure with regards to local block building.

## E – Consequences of Non-Conformance
When potential NO non-conformance with protocol rules and expectations is observed, the below actions shall be taken. The actions and follow-up procedures may differ based on the SM or staking avenue. For example, while NOs are known (i.e., identified) for the permissioned CM and SDVTM, NOs of the permissionless CSM may remain anonymous and reaching the NOs is only possible if a contact is voluntarily shared with the community. Furthermore, bonded SMs, like the CSM, offer additional options for automated conformance mechanisms compared to bond-less SMs like the CM and SDVTM.

The following table outlines the consequences for non-conformance with the Node Operator Responsibilities in regard to block proposals in Lido, and for which SM each action applies.

Action|CM|SDVTM|CSM
---|:---:|:---:|:---:
Upon detection of an unknown FR, contributors to the NOM workstream will reach out to the NO and ask for a clarification of the situation. If force majeure can be ruled out as the cause of the incident and no plausible explanation be provided, it must be assumed that the FR has been incorrectly configured and/or the proposed block's rewards have been stolen. Consequently, depending on the severity of the offense, community members may consider raising a formal issue with the NO on the Lido Research Forum, requesting remediative action, and seeking the transfer of missing rewards to the Lido Execution Layer Rewards Vault (see [D.1](#d1–-fee-recipient)).|:heavy_check_mark:|:heavy_check_mark:|:x:
Upon detection of an unknown FR, an amount of the affected NO's bond equal to the respective block's rewards and an additional disincentive of 0.1 ETH is algorithmically locked for 8 weeks, and the NO afforded a challenge period to discuss the situation in the [CSM Support category](https://research.lido.fi/c/csm-support/21) of the Lido Research Forum. Once the NO compensates Lido for the incident or upon expiry of the challenge period – if an agreement has been reached, that force majeure was the cause of the event – the lock is lifted. If neither a plausible explanation can be provided, nor a compensation is being transferred to the Lido Execution Layer Rewards Vault (see [D.1](#d1–-fee-recipient)), the [CSM Committee](https://research.lido.fi/t/community-staking-module-committee/8333) will initiate an [Easy Track motion](https://lido.fi/governance#easy-track) to propose to the Lido DAO that the locked portion of the NO's bond be burned as a penalty.</br>Any of the NO's validators that fail to provide a full bond – i.e. become unbonded – as a result of this measure are [requested to exit the protocol](https://lido.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmZTMfmJZsYHz61f2FjhYdh5VNu6ifjYQJzYUGkysHs8Uu). If the requested validators are not exited, they are marked as stuck, and no operator rewards are distributed to the NO until the stuck keys are exited.</br>**_NOTE:_** After the implementation of [EIP-7002: Execution Layer Triggerable Withdrawals](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7002) into Lido, stuck validators will instead be forcefully ejected at the protocol level.|:x:|:x:|:heavy_check_mark:
Upon detection of an unknown PS or a sequence of proposed blocks with payloads exclusively sourced from "may use" relays, although at the beginning of the allocated slots there were more valuable payloads available through "must use some" relays, contributors to the NOM workstream (in the CSM: CSM Committee) will reach out to the NO and ask for a clarification of the situation. If force majeure can be ruled out as the cause of the incident and no plausible explanation be provided, it must be assumed that an unvetted relay has been configured and/or the "must use some" selection ignored. Consequently, depending on the severity of the offense, community members may consider raising a formal issue with the NO on the Lido Research Forum, requesting remediative action, and seeking the transfer of missing rewards to the Lido Execution Layer Rewards Vault (see [D.1](#d1–-fee-recipient)).</br>**_NOTE:_** For CSMv2, an automation of the responses to such non-conformances is being considered.|:heavy_check_mark:|:heavy_check_mark:|If NO is identifiable

# Appendix
## Appendix A – Ethereum Standards, Auxiliary Proposer Mechanisms & Infrastructure
### A.1 – Advancing Ethereum's State
Advancing Ethereum's state revolves around attaching new blocks to the blockchain and begins with the PoS consensus mechanism pseudo-randomly allocating the block proposal duty for an upcoming slot to one of the active validators. Once the allocated slot arrives, the validator compiles relevant [Consensus Layer (CL) and EL data](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/blocks/#block-anatomy) into a block, signs, and broadcasts it to the network. The other validators then check the proposed block for validity and issue attestations voting for the chain they view as canonical. If the proposed block receives the heaviest attestation weight, it is selected as the chain head according to the [fork choice rule](https://eth2book.info/capella/part2/consensus/lmd_ghost/). The block can then be [finalized](https://eth2book.info/capella/part2/consensus/casper_ffg/) when two-thirds of the validator stake has attested to it and its descendants, thus ultimately updating the global state of Ethereum.

Sometimes a validator fails to populate a block with information beyond the minimum structure and header required for validity, or to propose an otherwise valid block to the network – the slot then remains empty, the state of Ethereum unchanged, and the affected block is referred to as "empty" respectively "missed". Another exceptional case is a block that is temporarily part of the canonical chain, but replaced by another block before finalization through events such as reorganizations ("reorgs") and "forks" of Ethereum's [Gasper consensus mechanism](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/gasper/). This can happen, e.g., because the block was proposed to the network too late to reach and obtain the attestations of a sufficient number of validators, because the blockchain split due to changes in (or differing interpretations of) protocol rules, or via changes to state or rules enforced via social consensus (a user-activated "soft fork"). Blocks that are abandoned before they become finalized are called "orphans".

### A.2 – Beacon Node APIs
The [Beacon Node APIs](https://ethereum.github.io/beacon-APIs) are exposed by beacon nodes (BNs) enabling the CC or VC to query and participate in the Beacon Chain (BC) according to [Ethereum's consensus specification](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs) as implemented by the different clients. The Beacon Node APIs are relevant to this SNOP both as the standard implemented which enables nodes to perform fundamental validator duties but also as the broader mechanism through which some APMs integrate into and augment the block proposal process – usually via the Builder API, which is technically separate and also entails connection with the EL (see [Appendix A.4.1.3](#a413–-builder-api)).

### A.3 – Local Block Building
In local block building, the validator allocated to the proposal duty of a slot packs transactions to be included in the block up to at most its [gas limit](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/#block-size) through the use of the attached execution client (EC). The transactions can originate from the NO of the validator itself, from users who sent them to the NO via some side-channel mechanism for inclusion, and most likely and predominantly from Ethereum's public mempool through the EL gossip network. A locally-built block by a validator is sometimes referred to as "vanilla".

### A.4 – Auxiliary Proposer Mechanisms
APMs are a framework and taxonomy for understanding and considering mechanisms that NOs can leverage to augment the block proposal process.<br>It consists of three key components:

- Mechanisms, which define the high-level objectives – e.g. PBS
- Protocols, which specify the rules governing the interactions between agents – e.g. MEV-Boost protocol for out-of-protocol PBS
- Sidecars, which are software implementations enabling the participation in these protocols – e.g. MEV-Boost as client-side relay tool

These mechanisms typically allow for some measure of increased functionality through the proposal process, and may separate the normal proposal mechanism into different stages which can be fulfilled by different agents. Often, APMs may lead to improved network efficiency, potentially enable additional value to be conveyed in a block and in some cases functionality that supports Ethereum's principles but that is not yet in the protocol.

APMs can include block building pipelines, block auctions, proposer commitments, or other innovations that introduce optimizations for transaction inclusion and ordering.

The framework allows for flexibility, as a single mechanism can have multiple protocol implementations, each supported by different sidecars, and it's even possible for sidecars to support multiple different protocols (and thus mechanisms).

#### A.4.1 – Proposer-Builder Separation
[PBS](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/pbs_censorship_resistance) is a mechanism designated to solve the increasing complexity of Ethereum block proposals and the risk of their centralization by sophisticated actors, exacerbating inequalities and running counter to the decentralization goals of the ecosystem. PBS addresses this by separating two aspects of the proposal process – the building of a payload and proposal of the block and its contents for the slot allocated by the protocol to the validator on duty. The separation of roles reduces the complexity for the proposer, who – in contrast to local block building (see [Appendix A.3](#a3–-local-block-building)) – only has to select from payloads constructed and sent by specialized third-party builders who compete in an auction, wrap that payload in a block, and propose it to the network. Ethereum therefore ensures that even NOs with limited resources (e.g., weaker hardware) can fulfill block proposal duties and actively contribute to the security of the network through the optimization of blockspace. 

##### A.4.1.1 – Out-Of-Protocol PBS
APMs can generally be thought of as being implemented in-protocol – i.e., as a part of the functionality of the Ethereum network and its core clients – or as out-of-protocol – i.e., relying on mechanisms that happen outside of or in parallel with in-protocol mechanisms. In the case of PBS, although a concept discussed since The Merge, there has not been an in-protocol version of it implemented into the core protocol – although some options have been proposed, e.g., [EIP-7732: Enshrined Proposer-Builder Separation (ePBS)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7732).

##### A.4.1.2 – MEV-Boost
[MEV-Boost](https://boost.flashbots.net/) is [Flashbot's reference design proposal](https://ethresear.ch/t/mev-boost-merge-ready-flashbots-architecture/11177) for a [PBS-friendly MEV marketplace](https://ethresear.ch/t/proposer-block-builder-separation-friendly-fee-market-designs/9725), whose architecture served as basis for the specification of Ethereum's Builder API (see [Appendix A.4.1.3](#a413–-builder-api)). The combination of Builder API and MEV-Boost – the protocol, corresponding relay client and BN sidecar – are the current most widespread implementation of out-of-protocol PBS. 

MEV-Boost has also addressed concerns about a weakness of PBS in terms of protecting Ethereum's censorship resistance that had already been expressed for in-protocol variants. The [minimum bid value ("min-bid")](https://www.flashbots.net/#9f18e7f297d6443c895d870df3ee5d2a) is a setting that allows proposers to forego a limited amount of rewards and, instead of sourcing externally constructed payloads for slots where the highest bid is below the min-bid configured by the proposer, generate payloads locally (see [Appendix A.3](#a3–-local-block-building)) – which increases the likelihood of inclusion for transactions which may be left out by third-party builders for reasons other than their pure value.

##### A.4.1.3 – Builder API
[Ethereum's temporary out-of-protocol PBS solution](https://ethereum.github.io/builder-specs/), for validators to delegate the payload construction duty of allocated slots to external builders. Unlike the MEV-Boost protocol and compatible sidecars, which function as multiplexers between a single proposer and a multitude of builders and relays, the Builder API is specialized on establishing a direct one-to-one connection between a proposer and builder – as configured in the former's CC.

##### A.4.1.4 – Sidecars
To ensure that the information provided to NOs regarding the solutions available to participate in out-of-protocol PBS is up-to-date despite the changing landscape in software offerings and implementations of technical features, contributors to the NOM workstream curate the sidecars and configuration methods vetted by the community for Lido in the APMs Allowed List (see [D.2](#d2--apms-allowed-list)).

On the list, APM sidecars – not only those for out-of-protocol PBS – are divided into the following categories:
* Consensus Client
* APM-Specific Client Implementation
* Multi-Beacon Node Validator Client
* Distributed Validator Client or Middleware

##### A.4.1.5 – Builder & Relay Operator Responsibilities & Incident Management
Given the trusted nature of out-of-protocol PBS, it behooves builder and relay operators to ensure that they and the infrastructure they operate function effectively, performantly, and efficiently, and that any and all communications are made timely and professionally.

Builder and relay operators should notify relevant Lido stakeholders – e.g., NOs and the NOM workstream – as soon as possible upon identification of an issue with any of the infrastructure that they operate. Notification may be performed through public – e.g., the Lido Research Forum or Discord – and/or private channels – e.g. Telegram group chats – so that NOs can proceed with appropriate changes to their configurations.

During an incident, builder and relay operators should provide regular updates with regard to the status. Following the conclusion, the operators should provide a report or post-mortem that details at minimum the root cause, fixes performed, if/how soon the infrastructure will be back in service, and what steps have been undertaken to prevent the likelihood of similar incidents in the future. Additionally, in cases where block production was adversely affected (see [D.4](#d4–-out-of-protocol-pbs-troubleshooting)), the operators should advise as to what steps will be taken – if any – to reimburse validators for any missed, invalid, etc. blocks and/or inaccurate bids.

Incidents will be reviewed on an ad-hoc basis by the NO and Lido communities. These reviews will inform DAO governance decisions regarding whether relay operators and the relays that they operate will continue to be considered vetted and ratified for use by NOs or not.

Relay operators which exhibit poor or otherwise unacceptable communication and especially performance of their relays – such as, but not limited to, inability to performantly and timely register validators or propagate bids and payloads, not verify bids, not simulate payload validity, etc. – and/or fail to conform with the expectations outlined above with regard to incident management, will be subject to removal from the MEV Boost Relay Allowed List (see [D.3](#d3–-mev-boost-relay-allowed-list)).
